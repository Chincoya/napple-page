# N(not)Apple Page

## Apple's old main page clone.

Within this repository you will find a somewhat static clone of an old [apple main page](https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/), made for the Microverse course, with the additional constraint of aligning all elements using float and flexbox.

## Getting started

No live version was deployed so, in order to view the page, you need to clone the repository with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chincoya/napple-page
```

Then, you can run it in any browser that supports flexbox layout and it's properties.
